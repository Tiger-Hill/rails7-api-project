# Rails 7 API App

Pre-requisites: Rails 7.0.4.3, Ruby 3.2.1, current as of 2023/06/01

This is a pretty (borderline excessively) detailed guide to help you set up a fully rounded development environment for a Rails 7 app in API mode. This can be puzzled together within days for a non-novice dev, but I wanted to save you the pain from chasing down various error messages to efficiently get to a developer-friendly setup within a few hours. 

From my choice of ruby / rails versions over `rails-jsonapi` to `friendly_id`: I have made many choices that you are welcome to change or disregard. Please jump to the appendix at the end to see which gems I've selected with links to relevant documentation or the [repo](https://github.com/Tiger-Hill/rails7-api-project/) for the below. Special thanks to [focus-me34](https://github.com/Focus-me34) & [mwinterdata](https://github.com/mwinterdata) for helping me with this :)
